Admin panel to configure and display breadcrumbs navigation.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you the ability to easily customize the breadcrumbs navigation, their display, colors, additional text and separator. Using the shortcode, you can easily add breadcrumbs to any page, either through the editor or directly into the code.
In the shortcode field, just click and the code will be copied. It is automatically generated when you select the items - "position" and "current page", which makes it even more flexible for display on different pages.
Using these options, you can select:
* Location of breadcrumbs
* Show on home page
* Display the Home link
* Show title to current page
You can use your own delimiter character, or leave it by default. It is also possible to select the color of breadcrumbs navigation links, separator and current page.
You can also easily change the link text of the main page, and additional text to the pages: search, tags, authorâ€™s page, 404, comments page and pagination pages.
